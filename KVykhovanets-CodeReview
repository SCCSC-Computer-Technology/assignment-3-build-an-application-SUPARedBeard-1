This one was actually similar to my program but when displaying the separate state details, mine was displayed in the default details view, but his was different (In a good way, he personalized it and the label that displays the info looks nice).
Although this program is really similar to mine, I would prefer mine for a couple of reasons: I personalized the background and buttons and I kind of like the way that I organized mine more. For example, when choosing a state from the drop down I have to go and find the “Show State Info” or “Search” also works. Then when I search a state, I also have to find the search button, which isn’t under the search bar, but more towards the bottom left, while the search bar is in the top right. I also have to find the sort button to sort. Mixed with these buttons is also the update, filter, and exit buttons. (This is a minor issue but if it was fixed/organized, it would make a huge difference, in my opinion)
^^In my program, I had the different options for sorting in a groupbox and the button to sort was directly under it.
Seems as if all possible issues are handled and message boxes appear if the user does something that could cause an issue.
One thing I would suggest is changing the background and design in general to be a bit less of the default design, just for aesthetic purposes
Code does not lack comments, and they explain everything well. 
Code compiles without any issues or warnings and I couldn’t find anything that will crash the program
Overall, it is very good! I like the program itself and everything works exactly as intended. I also forgot to mention, but the search bar is a great addition. I like how you can use either the  drop box or search bar to search for a state.
